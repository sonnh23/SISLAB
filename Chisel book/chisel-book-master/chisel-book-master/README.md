# Digital Design with Chisel

[![Book Cover](cover-small.jpg)](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html)

This book is an introduction to digital system design using a modern hardware
construction language, Chisel.
In this book we focus on a slightly higher abstraction level to get you up to
speed to build more complex, interacting digital systems.

A compiled PDF version of the book is available at
[Digital Design with Chisel PDF](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.pdf).

The book is available [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/168933603X/).
