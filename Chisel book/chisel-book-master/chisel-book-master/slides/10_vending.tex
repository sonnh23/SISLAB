\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Your final grade
\item Online exam
\item The Vending Machine project
\item
\item How many have finished the display multiplexer?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Your Final Grade}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You lab work, the vending machine
\begin{itemize}
\item What is working (TA checks)
\item Your report
\item Base function is a 10, extra functions needed for a 12
\end{itemize}
\item Written exam
\begin{itemize}
\item Two hour written exam
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exam Logistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Online exam with {\bf all materials and Internet access}
\begin{itemize}
\item I assume you will use those resource for doing a pretty good exam result and not for cheating :-)
\item Allowing Internet access actually reflects how we work today
\end{itemize}
\item You need access to the Internet during the two hours
\item I am available if there are questions on Slack and on Zoom
\item You need to be able to submit drawings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hand drawings and a webcam or smartphone
\item Use a drawing program on your laptop
\item Upload a .pdf (or .jpg), no drawing program specific file formats
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exam Logistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Online exam with all materials and Internet access
\item DTU has not (yet) decided on a single system
\begin{itemize}
\item There is also not much help (yet) :-(
\item We have to find out
\end{itemize}
\item Digital Exam or
\item within DTU Inside
\item Look at both
\item Do the poll
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exam Logistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is new to all of us: we will manage
\item We will do at least one (better two) test exams to learn the system
\item We will both learn how this works out
\item I will ask similar questions as the questions that will be in the real exam
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exam Topics and Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The pensum (reading lis) is on the \href{http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02139/}{web site}
\item Compute maximum frequency and delays of a given circuit
\item Answer multiple choice questions on digital design
\item Given a Chisel description of a circuit, draw it
\item Given a circuit drawing, sketch the Chisel description
\item Basically what we have done in the lab
\item No surprises (at least not too many ;-)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\item Hi Martin, I hope it is alright that I'm writing through this forum. But I am extremely nervous regarding the current situation, especially when we can see that DTU is not doing anything to help the students in ANY way. Why have we still not gotten any information regarding the exams? Whereas most of the other universities have already switched to digital exams? We need to soon start preparing soon and it is not helping when we do not have any idea of how things are going to turn out or what DTU plans on doing. I know that it is an ever-changing situation, but so far the situation has been predicted to worsen so why is DTU waiting to throw a "bomb" on its students regarding the exams. I have had already many sleepless night regarding this and would much rather not go down with stress, therefore could you please give us a better picture of what the future holds for us as students at DTU for this semester? 
%
%\item But a HUGE thank you to you for providing such great forums, such as Zoom and Slack for all of us to stay connected and allowing us to work efficiently, but most of my other professors are just ignoring this situation and going on as if we are not going through a global pandemic right now!

%%\item Jeg ved at det er meget at sp¿rge om, men jeg ville gerne vide, om det er mugligt, at fŒ et eksempel pŒ hvordan digi examen kommer til at se ud, nu chisel bliver brugt og ikke VHDL. Kunne vi mŒske fŒ en opgave, der kunne havt v¾ret eksamens opgaven? AltsŒ en opgave med lige sŒ mange sp¿rgsmŒl der minder om den vi kommer til at have til examen?
%%Selv ville jeg f¿le mig meget mere forberet til examen, hvis jeg kunne se og gennemf¿re en examens opgave, f¿r den rigtige examen.

%\item I know that's a lot to ask, but I wanted to know if it's possible to get an example of what the digi exam will look like, now chisel is being used and not VHDL. Could we maybe get a task that could have been the exam task? So an assignment with just as many questions reminiscent of the one we will have for the exam?
%Even I would feel much more prepared for the exam if I could see and complete an exam assignment before the real exam.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Vending Machine}
\begin{itemize}
\item Final project is a vending machine
\item Official doument: \href{https://cn.inside.dtu.dk/cnnet/filesharing/download/e712d72e-278e-4fef-a6ed-03eb20134acc}{Vending Machine Specification}
\item Will repeat the overview now
\item Group work
\item Final version shall be run in an FPGA
\item A lot can be done with testing and simulation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Vending Machine}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inputs: coins, buy
\item Display: price and current amount
\item Output: release can or error
\item Small challenge to multiplex the display
\item State machine with data path is the \emph{brain} of the VM
\item Guided step by step over several weeks
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vending Machine Specification I}

\item Sell 1 item and not returning any money
\item Set price with 5 switches (1--31 kr.)
\item Display price on two 7-segment displays (hex.)
\item Accept 2 and 5 kr. (two push buttons)
\item Display sum on two 7-segment displays (hex.)
