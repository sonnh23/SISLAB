# Slides for a 13 Week Course on Digital Design with Chisel

The slides are used in the course Digital Electronics 2 at the
Technical University of Denmark. The course aims for second semester
EE students without programming experience, but basic digital
electronics knowledge (transistors, gates, timing, minimal VHDL).

The slides are written in Latex.
The PDFs will be made available on the
[DE2 course web site](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02139/)
during the semester.

The slides are open-source, so feel free to adapt them for your
course as needed. Please acknowledge the source.
